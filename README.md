# physicsEngine
==Rough Draft==

The main componenets of my physics engine will model physical systems, signal processes, ML and NN, population dynamics in AI sims? 

The math going to be needed requires physics, differential equations, calculus of severable variables, and multivariate calculus

Differential Equations will be used for modeling physical systems (weather, fluid dynamics, and heat conduction) by using numerical methods to solve differntial equations. Signal processing to model systems like electrical circuits or audio processing. ML and NN, then Population Dynamics in AI Sims. 
- Newton's laws of motion
- Solving ODEs in Python for analyzing electrical circuit responses

Calculus of Severable Variables: Optimizing problems with algorithms to find the minima of maxima of functions with several variables
- Gradient descent algs optiimize cost functions for ML models
  Computer Graphics:
  - used to model transformations, lighting, and rendering!
 Robotics and Control Systems: Helps design trajectories for robots and optimize their movements
- Using Jacobian and Hessians for robotic motion planning
  Physics simulations: used where multiple forces or fields interact
  - compuiting the potential energy in a grabitational field or an electric field.

 Multivariate Calculus: ML used for calculation partial derivatives of loss functions
 -Derivatives of multivariable functions are used in backpropagation for training neural networks. 
 - probability density functions in probablistic models
  NLP
Data Visualization and Analysis
- tools like heat maps and contour plots require understading multivariate functions
-   Visualizing the relationship between variables in high-dimensional data
Game development
- Calculation collisions and physical interactions in dynamic environments.
